# RISC-V
![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Development-Stopped-red)

A RISC-V implementation, realized for the Integrated systems architecture course of Politecnico di Torino. In the *src* folder there is every vhdl file used for the final implementation. In the *synthesis* folder there is the script used to synthesize the RISC-V datapath and the relative reports for area/timing/power. In the *place&route* folder there is the physical implementation of the RISC-V (ABS and LITE, read the *report* for further informations) with the relative parasitics extraction, gate count and timing reports.
